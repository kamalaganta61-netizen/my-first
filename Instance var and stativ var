# INSTANCE VARIABLE AND STATIC VARIABLE
# INSTANCE VARIABLE:
# an instance variable is a variable that belongs to a specific object(instance) of a class.
class student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name         # instance variable
        self.age = age           # instance variable

# create two objects 
s1 = student("NANDIRAJU", 40)
s2 = student("SUJATHA", 35)

print(s1.name,s1.age)
print(s2.name, s2.age)


# STATIC VARIABLE:
# a static variable is shared by all abjects of the class.
# it belongs to the class itself, not to any one object.
class student:
    college_name = "ABC college"      # static variable
