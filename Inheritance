# Inheritance:

# It allows a child class (subclass) to use the properties and methods of a parent class (superclass).

# Four types of inheritance; 1.single , 2.multilevel , 3.multiple , 4. hierarchiel.

# 1.Single Inheritance: One parent → one child

# Parent class
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Animal speaks"

# Child class
class Dog(Animal):
    def bark(self):
        return "Dog barks"

# Create object of child class
d = Dog()
print(d.speak())  
print(d.bark())   

# 2. Multiple Inheritance: One child → multiple parents
# two parent classes and one child class.

class Father:
    def skills(self):
        return "Driving, Cooking"

class Mother:
    def skills(self):
        return "Singing, Dancing"

class Child(Father, Mother):
    def skills(self):
        return Father.skills(self) + ", " + Mother.skills(self) + ", Python Programming"

c = Child()
print(c.skills())

# 3.Multilevel Inheritance:Grandparent → Parent → Child
class Grandfather:
    def property(self):
        return "Land"

class Father(Grandfather):
    def house(self):
        return "House"

class Son(Father):
    def car(self):
        return "Car"

s = Son()
print(s.property())  # From Grandfather
print(s.house())     # From Father
print(s.car())       # From Son


# 4.Hierarchical Inheritance:One parent → multiple children
# Parent class
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Animals can make sounds"

# Child class 1
class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Dog barks"

# Child class 2
class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Cat meows"

# Child class 3
class Cow(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Cow moos"

# Create objects of child classes
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()
cow = Cow()

# Accessing methods
print(dog.speak())   # Inherited from Animal
print(dog.sound())   # From Dog

print(cat.speak())   # Inherited from Animal
print(cat.sound())   # From Cat

print(cow.speak())   # Inherited from Animal
print(cow.sound())   # From Cow
