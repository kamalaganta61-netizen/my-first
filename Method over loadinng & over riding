# 1. Method Overloading:

# Method overloading : Method overloading means having multiple methods with the same name but different number or type of parameters in the same class.

class A :
    def sum(self,a,b):
        return a + b
    def suma(self,a,b):
        return a + b + c
    
obj = A()
print(obj.sum(1,2))

# Example : Simulated Overloading using Default Arguments:
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a=None, b=None, c=None):
        if a is not None and b is not None and c is not None:
            return a + b + c
        elif a is not None and b is not None:
            return a + b
        else:
            return a

calc = Calculator()
print(calc.add(10, 20))      
print(calc.add(10, 20, 30))  
print(calc.add(5))           


# 2. Method Overriding :
# Method overriding means a child class defines a method with the same name as a method in its parent class, replacing its behavior.
# Same method name in parent and child classes.

class A :
    def display(self):
        print("this is class A")

class B(A):
    def display(self):
        print ("this is class B")
        super().display()
obj = B()
obj . display()
